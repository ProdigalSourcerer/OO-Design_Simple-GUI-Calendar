This project is a GUI Calendar application I developed as part of an Object-Oriented Design class. It implements a model-view-controller architecture, and is my first fairly complex design using Java GUI objects. I'm proud of it because I think it accomplishes what the assignment called for and a bit more, and looks clean and functional. I had to do a fair bit of learning outside the curriculum, especially in understanding the use of the JLayeredPane component which was not covered in the course, but I didn't feel I could make the project look as polished as I wanted it to without it. There are still changes I would make, but as it is, and given the time I had, I feel like it's pretty solid work. I've also included it because it's an example of a project that is 100% my own work (as opposed to a group project.)
